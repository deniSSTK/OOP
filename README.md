# OOP ‚Äì University Lab Assignments

This repository contains lab assignments and practice work completed as part of my Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) course at university.

## üéØ Purpose

- **Educational Use Only:** This repository exists solely for academic purposes. It includes my solutions to course-assigned exercises and labs, designed to help practice and reinforce core OOP concepts.
- **Progress Tracking:** It serves as a record of my learning and development throughout the course and is required by the university as part of the curriculum.

## üìÅ Structure

- The folders follow the naming convention `l-2-x` and each one contains a separate lab.

  - Polymorphism
  - Interfaces and Abstraction
  - Encapsulation
